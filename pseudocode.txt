SIMON GAME.
Gameplay rules: 
1-Game Start
  //TODO: Player presse any button on the keyboard.
  //TODO: Fires up main functions.
  //TODO: (Re)set player score to 0  
2-Algorithm choose a random number from 0 to 3 (or color)
  // Using the Math.random method, select a number from 0 to 3. DONE
  // Store number at the end of its array. DONE
  // Based on the numbers in the array, animate (+sound) the corresponding buttons on the page. DONE
  //todo Wait for player input 
3-Player need to input the same sequence that the algorithm declared. 
  //// Player tries to replicate the sequence the algorithm just played by pressing on the buttons that was animated.
  //// Animation (+sound) on button click (using the mouse, v.1) is played to feedback player that action has been registered. 
  //// Player input is stored into player's array.
  ** (what if the player simply never press on a button... should there be a timer?)
4-Player sequence is verified against Algo sequence.
  //todo: Start by dertermining if the length of the two arrays are the same. 
  //todo:  Using a nested for loop, it is possible to determine if both array are the same.
  ** (is there a built in method that does just that?)
  //todo: If evaluated as true, add 1 to player score and go back to step 2
  ////: If evaluated as false, go too step 5
5-Game Over.
  ////: Change background color of page to a different color.
  ////: Display "GAME OVER, Press any key to restart" to player
